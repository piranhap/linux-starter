# Intro

This document should aid on slowly getting your feet wet within the Linux environment. If you feel not so sure about it, we recommend running a virtual machine with Linux on it, things break, revert to the latest snapshot. (Google for terms you don't understand)

# Ok I'm here, what do I do now? 

That's the fun part, we do nothing! Just kidding. The main thing is to have a goal in mind, for example with Windows, the goal is to have a daily driver computer, somewhere to be on the internet, social media, use paint, idk. This I'd say is the most general approach to Linux. 

Linux has both the terminal and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) so you can interact with it. Any Linux environment can have a GUI, which is called 'Desktop Environment' in the Linux world. 

## The terminal

The command-line, in the movies, where someone enters all the cool commands like a L33t h4ck3r. This may seem intimidating at first, especially knowing that our brains are wired to use Windows. Leave that mindset, Linux is something completely different, and that has both downsides and upsides. 

Make it fun for yourself, at the end of the day you are reading this cause something in Linux sparked your interest, explore that! There are no walls here (mostly) compared to other Operating Systems. See this as making a computer actually yours, instead of company property. 

As you embrace it, I hope you come up to the Terminal at some point, it is fun I promise, `cmatrix` and `cowsay` or the legendary `neofetch` are commands that everyone has run in their terminal at least once. I hope. Anyway, as you embrace it, do not get too impatient, but also don't overwork yourself, this computer you set up, works for you, it enhances you, don't let it become your boss! Also don't become too dependent from it.
ANYWAY, again, as you go through stuff you are gonna need guidance and help on using stuff, well that is where we use all of the help commands we usually use. These are but not limited to: 

- `man` - Manual pages
- `apropos` - not even sure what this is, you probably should `man apropos` in your terminal
- `whatis`

These are the OG commands for getting help, more seasoned individuals use it, while it is not bad to use it, we need to understand newer generations just don't work the same way as older ones. We are sadly the ADHD generation, filled with impatience and subway surfer videos. We need to come up with stuff that helps the newer generations, keep the Linux Legacy, empowering people since whenever Linus made the Kernel. 

On top of the commands above, I recommend the following:
- `wikiman` this downloads wikis locally so you can check them out on your terminal: https://github.com/filiparag/wikiman
- `TLDR` stands for "Too long, didnt read", so a brief version for commands, the one I use is this one: https://github.com/tealdeer-rs/tealdeer
- `bat` great for making things more colorful and easier for people coming from other O.Ss https://github.com/sharkdp/bat
- `bat` scripts, which further enhance stuff :D

Don't go online and immediately install them, try with the basic ones, then you can start adding as you go. I don't want to give you more information since the whole point is learning by exploring. 

Don't forget:
- You are not expected to memorize all Linux commands, learn how to get to them
- This is more of a journey rather than just swapping to a different os for fun. Once you start making things your own, I hope you get the feeling that your computer, is YOURS.
- Don't fry your brain overcomplicating things, actually, Linux will (almost) always follow the principle KISS (Keep it Stupid Simple), search for information online when you can, ask in forums, discords, channels, other githubs, etc. Even ask an AI if you are into that. (Do not put personal info on a AI plz)

If you like games I recommend taking the game approach to Linux, a great example is using 
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/ 

A game where you need to understand the terminal more and more to go to the next level.
