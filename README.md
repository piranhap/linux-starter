# Intro

This document should aid on slowly getting your feet wet within the Linux environment. If you feel not so sure about it, we recommend running a virtual machine with Linux on it, things break, revert to the latest snapshot. (Google for terms you don't understand)

# Ok I'm here, what do I do now? 

That's the fun part, we do nothing! Just kidding. The main thing is to have a goal in mind, for example with Windows, the goal is to have a daily driver computer, somewhere to be on the internet, social media, use paint, idk. This I'd say is the most general approach to Linux. 

Linux has both the terminal and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) so you can interact with it. Any Linux environment can have a GUI, which is called 'Desktop Environment' in the Linux world. 

## The terminal

The command-line, in the movies, where someone enters all the cool commands like a L33t h4ck3r. This may seem intimidating at first, especially knowing that our brains are wired to use Windows. Leave that mindset, Linux is something completely different, and that has both downsides and upsides. 

Make it fun for yourself, at the end of the day you are reading this cause something in Linux sparked your interest, explore that! There are no walls here (mostly) compared to other Operating Systems. See this as making a computer actually yours, instead of company property. 

As you embrace it, I hope you come up to the Terminal at some point, it is fun I promise, `cmatrix` and `cowsay` or the legendary `neofetch` are commands that everyone has run in their terminal at least once. I hope. Anyway, as you embrace it, do not get too impatient, but also don't overwork yourself, this computer you set up, works for you, it enhances you, don't let it become your boss! Also don't become too dependent from it.
ANYWAY, again, as you go through stuff you are gonna need guidance and help on using stuff, well that is where we use all of the help commands we usually use. These are but not limited to: 
- `man` - Manual pages
-
